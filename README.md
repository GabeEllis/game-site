Thank you for checking out Game Site.

To start, open the code in a code editor of your choice.
Then open up your terminal and type
npm install
This will download your node_modules folder so the application can run.

There are still some more things you will need to install from your terminal again.
npm i axios react-router-dom js-chess-engine sass

Once you have everything installed, then type npm start into your terminal and the application should open up in your browswer at http://localhost:3000/.
