Thank you for checking out Game Site.

<!-- Features -->

At the moment only chess is available, but the user can either play against their friend on the same device or a computer with 4 different difficulty levels.
There is also a login/sign up feature that allows the user to input data including their board theme preference.

<!-- Planned Features -->

I plan on making it so users can play multiplayer on difference devices online. Right now chess is the only game, but sudoku is in production right now and other games are planned to be added as well.

<!-- Download Instructions -->

To start, open the code in a code editor of your choice.
Then open up your terminal and type

This will download your node_modules folder so the application can run.

There are still some more things you will need to install from your terminal again.
